- people have their own gardens
- memory power (in each person's mind) / many perspectives
- how learn.fits weave into this
- tribal knowledge -> collective explicit wisdom
- decisions across the principle lifecycle
- operational wants -> principles
- how to wield a principle
  - asking questions
- how does this intersect with our personal boundaries?
  
- domains mentioned: partners over email, lock in contracts, work-life-balance, this email needs to be send
- without priorities, principles might be in conflict?
  - strategy could answer this?

- principles discussed/named:
  - "show up well with allies" ->
    - "allies are responded to in a timely way" -> 
      - "principled allied allies get a response within 6hrs" #operationalized via a SOA/rule

- principles should be written down?
- principles reading, meetings, "reflective agent"
- next steps 
  - something on calendar (tues 23rd)
  - each person, bring a proposal principle to next call and prepare to discuss use and crafting
  

- triggers: "need to response to this email"
- goals

- (in an LLM take) context, goals, principles - what does honoring these principles in this situation look like?
- "clear blue crystal principles"
- proposal principles
- operational - "know what people are working on"
