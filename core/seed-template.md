# Seed Template 🌱

_For quick capture when you notice a pattern but don't have time to elaborate. Seeds should be promoted to full principles or pruned within 30 days._

## [PRINCIPLE NAME] 🌱

**Captured:** YYYY-MM-DD | **By:** @name

**Tension:** _One sentence: what tradeoff does this navigate?_

**Therefore:** _One sentence: the guidance itself._

**Trigger:** _What made you notice this? (project, conversation, failure)_

## Notes

- Seeds are intentionally lightweight—capture the insight before it slips away
- The 🌱 emoji makes seeds visually scannable when mixed with full principles
- Review seeds within 30 days: promote to full principle or prune
- If you find yourself unable to articulate the tension, the seed may not be a principle—it might be a preference, a one-off decision, or a solution looking for a problem
