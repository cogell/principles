## [PRINCIPLE NAME]

**Confidence:** ◐ (○ = emerging, ◐ = practiced, ● = proven)

**Domains:** `proposals` `ui/ux` `process` `communications` `engineering` `strategy`

---

### Context

_When do you reach for this principle? What situation or smell triggers it?_

### Tension

_What competing forces or tradeoffs does this principle help navigate? Good principles resolve genuine tensions—if there's no tension, it's probably just a preference._

### Therefore

_The principle itself, stated as guidance. Alexander uses "Therefore:" to pivot from problem to solution. Keep it concrete enough to act on, abstract enough to apply across contexts._

### In Practice

_1-3 brief examples from actual Empire work. These build shared memory and make the principle legible to newcomers._

- **[Project/Context]:** How the principle was applied (or violated, and what happened)

---

### When This Is Missing _(optional)_

_What symptoms or smells indicate this principle was needed but not applied? What does the failure mode look like?_

### When to Ignore _(optional)_

_Contexts where this principle doesn't apply or where following it causes more harm than good. Principles have scope—over-application kills them._

### Origin Story _(optional)_

_Where did this come from? A project failure? A mentor? Another field? Stories make principles sticky._
