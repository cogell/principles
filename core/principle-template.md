## [PRINCIPLE NAME]

**Status:** Draft | Active | Deprecated

**Confidence:** ◐ (○ = emerging, ◐ = practiced, ● = proven)

**Domains:** `proposals` `ui/ux` `process` `communications` `engineering` `strategy`

---

### Mantra

_A single sentence you can drop into a meeting. Format: "Prefer X over Y when Z."_

---

### Context

_When do you reach for this principle? What situation or smell triggers it?_

_Focus on the **situation**, not the tradeoff—describe the moment you recognize this principle applies._

### Tension

_What competing forces or tradeoffs does this principle help navigate?_

_Focus on the **forces in conflict**—name both sides. Good principles resolve genuine tensions. If there's no tension, it's probably just a preference._

### Therefore

_The principle itself, stated as guidance. Alexander uses "Therefore:" to pivot from problem to solution. Keep it concrete enough to act on, abstract enough to apply across contexts._

---

### Decision Test

_A fast heuristic someone can run in 30 seconds mid-debate._

**If/Then format:**
> If [conditions], then [default action], unless [exception].

**Or checklist format:**
- [ ] Condition 1
- [ ] Condition 2
- [ ] Condition 3
→ If all checked, apply this principle.

---

### In Practice

_1-3 examples that make this principle concrete. Hypothetical examples are allowed initially but should be replaced with real Empire examples within 30 days._

- **[Project/Context]:** How the principle was applied (or violated, and what happened)
- 🔮 **[Hypothetical]:** _Plausible scenario illustrating the principle (replace with real example when available)_

---

### Evidence

_Links to artifacts that support the confidence level: PRDs, incidents, retros, metrics, customer outcomes, etc._

| Confidence | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| ○ Emerging | 1 example or strong rationale |
| ◐ Practiced | 3+ examples across teams/projects |
| ● Proven | Repeatedly predictive + survived a hard tradeoff + clear upside |

### Misuse & Counterexample

_How this principle fails when over-applied or weaponized._

**Misapplied when:** _Conditions where this principle doesn't fit_

**Failure mode:** _What people do when they hide behind this principle_

**Counterexample:** _A real or plausible case where you should do the opposite_

---

### Exceptions & Escalation

_The "break glass" clause. Prevents principle purity from blocking reality._

**Exceptions:** _When violating this principle is explicitly allowed_

**Escalation:** _Who can approve a deviation, or what forum decides_

---

### Connections _(optional on first draft)_

_Don't let this block principle creation. Add connections as you discover them._

**Supports:** _Larger/upstream principles this one serves_
- [[Principle Name]]

**Enabled by:** _Smaller/downstream principles that make this one possible_
- [[Principle Name]]

**Tensions with:** _Principles that sometimes compete with this one (healthy tension, not contradiction)_
- [[Principle Name]]

**Review cadence:** Quarterly | Semiannual

**Last reviewed:** YYYY-MM-DD
