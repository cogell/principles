# Principle Template Usage Notes

## Naming Principles

Alexander's pattern names are evocative and memorable: "Light on Two Sides of Every Room," "Intimacy Gradient," "A Place to Wait." Aim for names that:
- Can be dropped into conversation ("this feels like it violates [Name]")
- Hint at the insight without explaining it
- Avoid jargon where possible

**Weak:** "Stakeholder Alignment Process"  
**Stronger:** "Everyone in the Room"

## On Confidence Levels

- **○ Emerging:** We've seen this work once or twice, or it's a hypothesis worth testing
- **◐ Practiced:** Applied successfully across multiple projects/contexts, but still refining
- **● Proven:** Battle-tested, would be surprised if this ever steered us wrong

Principles can move backwards—sometimes context changes or we learn we over-generalized.

## On Tensions

The best principles exist because there's a genuine tradeoff. "Move fast" and "get it right" are both valid—the interesting question is when each applies. If your principle has no tension, ask whether it's actually a principle or just a description of good work.

## Domain Tags

Maintained shortlist. Propose additions via [process TBD], but resist proliferation—tags are for filtering, not precision.

| Tag | Scope |
|-----|-------|
| `proposals` | Client-facing scoping, SOWs, pitches |
| `ui/ux` | Interface and experience design |
| `process` | Internal workflows, rituals, coordination |
| `communications` | Writing, presentations, stakeholder updates |
| `engineering` | Code, architecture, technical decisions |
| `strategy` | High-level direction, prioritization, positioning |

Note: The most valuable principles often span multiple domains. Tag broadly rather than narrowly.

## Lifecycle

**Seed → Emerging → Practiced → Proven**

Seeds get 30 days to become full principles or get pruned. Confidence levels can move in either direction as context changes or you learn the boundaries.
