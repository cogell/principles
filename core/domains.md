# Domain Tags

Maintained shortlist. Propose additions sparingly—tags are for filtering, not precision.

| Tag | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `proposals` | Client-facing scoping, SOWs, pitches |
| `ui/ux` | Interface and experience design |
| `process` | Internal workflows, rituals, coordination |
| `communications` | Writing, presentations, stakeholder updates |
| `engineering` | Code, architecture, technical decisions |
| `strategy` | High-level direction, prioritization, positioning |

## Usage

The most valuable principles often span multiple domains. Tag broadly rather than narrowly.

## Future Candidates

Add only when retrieval genuinely suffers without them:

- `security`
- `sales`
- `ops/reliability`
- `people`
