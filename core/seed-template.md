# Seed Template

_For quick capture when you notice a pattern but don't have time to elaborate. Seeds should be promoted to full principles or pruned within 30 days._

## [PRINCIPLE NAME]

**Captured:** YYYY-MM-DD | **By:** @name

**Mantra:** _"Prefer X over Y when Z."_

**Tension:** _One sentence: what tradeoff does this navigate?_

**Therefore:** _One sentence: the guidance itself._

**Decision test:** _If [condition], then [action]. (optional but valuable)_

**Trigger:** _What made you notice this? (project, conversation, failure)_

## Notes

- Seeds are intentionally lightweight—capture the insight before it slips away
- The seed emoji (used in file names or tags) makes seeds visually scannable when mixed with full principles
- Review seeds within 30 days: promote to full principle or prune
- If you find yourself unable to articulate the tension, the seed may not be a principle—it might be a preference, a one-off decision, or a solution looking for a problem
- A good seed has at minimum: **Mantra + Tension + Therefore**—these three prevent the "principle becomes slogan" failure mode
